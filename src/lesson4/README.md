# Lesson 4

Control Structures (Sequence/Selection Structure)

Usage of `if`, `if else`, `else if`, and `switch case`

## Activities

### Activity 1: Sequence Structure

#### Average Grade Calculator

Create  a program that will compute the average of your final grade. The user will input value for prelim, midterm and finals. Compute the total and its average. Display the following output:

### Activity 2: If Statement

#### Grade Remarks

Create a program that will input grade and will display the corresponding equivalent. Use if statement in a program.
| GRADE | EQUIVALENT |
|-------|------------|
|A   |EXCELLENT      |
|B   |VERY GOOD      |
|C   |GOOD           |
|D   |FAIR           |
|E   |POOR           |
|F   |NEEDS IMPROVEMENT   |

#### Odd or Even

Create another program that will input a number and will determine if it is odd or even number. Use if else statement in the program.

#### Order Details

Create a program that will input customer’s name, purchased item, quantity, price and cash. Compute the Total Bill and the change of the customer. If the customer reaches the total bill which is greater than or equal to 1000 pesos, he or she gets 30% discount of his/her total bill. Use if else statement.

### Activity 4: Else if

#### Grade Equivalent Calculator

Create a program that will input a grade and will display its corresponding equivalent based on the given below. Use logical operator and else if statement in the program.

| Grades  | Equivalent  |
|---|---|
| 99 - 100  | 1.00  |
| 96 - 98  | 1.25  |
| 93 - 95  | 1.50  |
| 90 - 92  | 1.75  |
| 87 - 89  | 2.00  |
| 84 – 86  | 2.25  |
| 81 – 83  | 2.50  |
| 77 – 80  | 2.75  |
| 75 - 76  | 3.00  |
| Below 75  | 5.00  |
