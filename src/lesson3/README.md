# Lesson 3

Variables and Input.

Getting and parsing input from the user.
Use of `BufferedReader`, `Scanner`, and `JOptionPane` (pop-up window)

## Lecture Examples

- [Using `BufferedReader`](src/lesson3/Example1.java)
- [Using `Scanner`](src/lesson3/Example2.java)
- [Parsing command line arguments](src/lesson3/Example3.java)
- [Using `JOptionPane`](src/lesson3/Example4.java)
- [Adding two numbers using `JOptionPane`](src/lesson3/Example5.java)

## Activities

### Activity 1

**Prelim Grade Calculator**
Create a program that will compute your midterm grade. The user will input name, course, grade for two quizzes, two recitations, two projects and grade for exam rating Compute the average of two quizzes, two recitation and two projects. Use these formulas to compute the midterm grade. Class standing equals to the sum of the quiz, recitation and project divide by 3. To compute prelim grade, class standing should be multiplied by 2 and add the result for exam rating.

### Activity 2

**Dollar to Peso**
Create a program that converts the input dollar ($) into its equivalent peso Presume that one dollar is equivalent to 50.50 pesos. Then display the result on the screen.

## Comments

EZ as well, just time consuming somehow. The problems are kinda hard to understand as well, so it took me quite some time to implement it into code (like the fourth activity).
